      <h2>About Mr. Entrepreneur</h2>
      <p>
        Mr. Entrepreneur is a marketplace-style directory designed to help local vendors and small shops
        quickly find manufacturers and suppliers tailored to their sector. The site's goal is to reduce
        friction in sourcing — whether you run a small bakery, a furniture store, an electronics kiosk,
        or a farm supplies outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
        This demo provides a curated list of common business sectors (Food & Beverage, Fashion & Clothing,
        Electronics, Construction, Beauty & Personal Care, Hospitality & Catering, Agriculture, Furniture,
        Automotive, and Health & Medical Supplies) and sample supplier names to help vendors get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is a front-end demonstration. To make it production-ready, consider adding a backend,
        secure authentication, supplier details pages, ratings & reviews, contact forms, and a messaging system.
